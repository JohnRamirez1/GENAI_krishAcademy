Inferencing is the process of drawing conclusions or making educated guesses based on available information, data, or evidence. It involves using reasoning, logic, and context to interpret and understand the meaning or implications of a situation, text, or set of data.
Inferencing can be thought of as "reading between the lines" or making connections between pieces of information to form a cohesive understanding. It requires the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information to arrive at a conclusion or make a prediction.
